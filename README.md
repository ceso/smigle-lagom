## Overview

Smigle Lite is a minimalist Hugo theme focused on simplicity, performance, and privacy. It was created as a streamlined alternative to the original [Smigle](https://gitlab.com/ian-s-mcb/smigle-hugo-theme) theme, removing unnecessary elements while maintaining the core principles of being lightweight with no JavaScript or tracking.

### Core Principles

* **No JavaScript** - Pure HTML and CSS for maximum performance
* **No Tracking** - No Google analytics, cookies, or any user tracking
* **No External Dependencies** - No external fonts, comment sections, or CDN resources
* **Minimal Design** - Focus on content without distractions

## Features

### Key Differences from Original Smigle

Smigle Lite streamlines the original theme by:

* Removing the user profile image requirement
* Eliminating the site tagline
* Removing reading time estimates
* Removing word count displays
* Simplifying post metadata presentation
* Redesigning taxonomy pages as simple lists with counts
* Updating the footer with proper attributions
* Various spacing improvements and CSS optimizations
* Post Navigations
* Recent Posts displayed on each post configurable in the config file

- `Jan`: Month (abbreviated)

Examples:

- `"06/01/02"` becomes "23/07/15" for July 15, 2023
- `"January 2, 2006"` becomes "July 15, 2023"

```yaml
taxonomies:

  category: categories  # URL will be /categories/category-name/
```

You can add custom taxonomies or rename existing ones through this configuration.

taxonomies:

```

This configuration should be saved as `config.yaml` in your Hugo site's root directory.

## Content Configuration

### Front Matter Examples

Each content file in Hugo can have front matter that determines how it's processed and displayed:

```yaml
---
title: "My First Post"
date: 2023-07-15T10:00:00
draft: false
categories: ["Technology"]
tags: ["hugo", "tutorial"]
summary: "A quick introduction to Smigle Lite"
---
```

For pages that should appear in the menu:

```yaml
---
title: "About Me"
menu:
  main:
    weight: 2
---
```

## Customization

### Custom CSS

To add your own CSS customizations, create a file at `assets/css/custom.css` in your site root. This will be automatically included.

Example custom CSS:

```css
/* assets/css/custom.css */
body {
  font-family: 'Your Preferred Font', sans-serif;
}

.site-header {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```

### Content Organization

Smigle Lite works best with the following content structure:

```
content/
├── posts/           # Blog posts
├── pages/           # Static pages
└── about/           # About page
    └── index.md
```

### Front Matter Options

```yaml
---
title: "My Post Title"
date: 2023-07-15T10:00:00-05:00
draft: false
categories: ["Technology"]
tags: ["hugo", "tutorial"]
summary: "Optional summary that will be displayed in lists"
---
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Shortcodes

Smigle Lite supports all built-in Hugo shortcodes plus any you create in your site's `layouts/shortcodes` directory.

### Image Handling

For responsive images:

```markdown
{{< figure src="/images/my-image.jpg" title="Image Title" alt="Image description" >}}
```

### Taxonomies

Customize how taxonomies are displayed by editing your site's configuration:

```yaml
taxonomies:
  category: categories
  tag: tags
  series: series
```

## Updating the Theme

To update the theme when used as a git submodule:

```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

Or for all submodules:

```bash
git submodule foreach git pull origin main
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Theme not loading**: Ensure your `config.yaml` has `theme: smigle-lite` (or `theme = "smigle-lite"` in TOML)

2. **Styling problems**: Check for CSS conflicts with custom CSS

3. **Missing content**: Verify your content is not marked as `draft: true` unless using the `--buildDrafts` flag
